*"Nevertheless... the turtle moves!"* - Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett

This is a Turtle module for the IPython notebook. It's based on code by
`aspidites <https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/aspidites>`_, one of two groups at
`Macewan University <http://macewan.ca/wcm/index.htm>`_ that built Turtle
as a class assignment (the other was `PACattack <http://macewancmpt395.github.io/PACattack/>`_;
I could have based this on either, but I had to pick one).
